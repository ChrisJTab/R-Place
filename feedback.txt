Outline your architecture 3.5/7

[0.5] All tools listed and justified

[1] Explain why Tool1 used was appropriate for the task
(Serverless explained)
[0] Explain why Tool2 used was appropriate for the task
[0] Explain why Tool3 used was appropriate for the task

[1] System diagram is present
[1] System diagram explains parts of the system, at least somewhat clear
[0] System diagram is excellent, a great guide to the system, clearly explains it all in appropriate detail

Explain how tools interact with each other 3/5

[1] Some explanation of individual tools interaction
[1] Some explanation of tools interacting on critical functions
[0] Great explanation of tools interacting on critical functions
[0] Explanation of interaction for initial boar pool d load
(No details)
[1] Explanation of interaction for update, including broadcasting

Justify Design (we mark 3 system strengths) 5.5/6

[1] Strength 1 listed
[0.5] Strength 1 justified/explained
(Infinite vertical & horizontal scalability?)

[1] Strength 2 listed
[1] Strength 2 justified/explained

[1] Strength 3 listed
[1] Strength 3 justified/explained

Justify Design (we mark 2 system weaknesses) 0/4

[0] Weakness 1 listed
[0] Weakness 1 justified/explained

[0] Weakness 2 listed
[0] Weakness 2 justified/explained

Strengths and weaknesses can be taken from:
	Consistency
	Availability
	Partition tolerance
	Load balancing
	Caching
	Disaster recovery
	Orchestration
	Monitoring
	Horizontal scalability
	Vertical scalability
	Security & Permissions
	Latency/Throughput
	Persistence
	Number of simultaneous clients
	…

Discussing the system's performance [BONUS]
	/1 Graph showing performance of system under load1
	/1 Analysis of system performance under load1


Demo (weight 50%): 14/16

	7/7 Functionality
		[1] 1 Board is loaded when the site is visited
		[1] 1 1000x1000 board is implemented
		[1] 1 Supports at least 16 colors
		[1] 1 Full board is loaded under 3 seconds
		[1] 1 Full board is loaded under 1 seconds
		[1] 1 Board updates are broadcasted to all active users
			. Refreshing the board periodically is not acceptable
		[1] 1 Spam protection. Users are limited to 1 request per 5 mins (or any other defined time period)
		(Should code for rate-limiter)

	0/1 Monitoring
    		[0] 1 Tools monitor some or all components of the system
		(Only cloud formation)

	1/1 Availability
		[1] 1 Show the system running in 2 availability zones

	2/2 Security & Permissions
		[1] 1 Show & discuss the IAM roles used
		[1] 1 Show & discuss subnets used
			. If applicable. Some designs might not require subnets. In this case, students must discuss why that is the case

	3/4 Orchestration
		[0.5] 1 Automate launching the system
		(Has CF file, does not use it)
		[1] 1 Automate scaling up the system
			. Students with serverless architecture must explain how their system detects and adapts to spikes in performance. If they do not know, they only get 0.5
		[1] 1 Automate scaling down the system
			. Same as above
		[0.5] 1 Automate shutdowning the system

	1/1 Design quality
		Groups of 2 at least 6-7 tools
		Groups of 3 at least 10-11 tools
		[1] 1 Meet the requirements above
		(7)


	0/2 Creativity [BONUS]
		[0] 2 Additional features beyond the url shortner canvas application
			. Heatmap
			. Timelapse
			. Other


Individual Task: 30 mins

1: Create a Lambda function that unzips files uploaded to csc409UTORIDa3zipped into csc409UTORIDa3unzipped. csc409UTORIDa3zipped and csc409UTORIDa3unzipped are S3 buckets. Use the following for the Lambda code, DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE, JUST CHANGE THE BUCKET NAME: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yjdw4btOwJA3hXGcwIT8C8-Q_BaJbbwV/view?usp=sharing

2: Create a Lambda function that counts the occurrences of the word “hello” in files uploaded to csc409UTORIDa3unzipped, then records the file name and counts into a DynamoDB table called csc409UTORIDa3counts

For Testing:
	Use the following zip to test:
